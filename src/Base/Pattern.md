# WHAT IS PROBLEM SOLVING PATTERN ?

In the context of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), a problem-solving pattern refers to a general approach or strategy used to solve a certain category of problems. These patterns provide a structured way to analyze and solve problems, and they often involve specific techniques or algorithms.

# SOME PROBLEM SOLVING PATTERNS...

- Frequency Counter
- Multiple Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Divide and Conquer
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Backtracking
- & Many more!

## FREQUENCY COUNTERS

This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(N^2) operations with arrays / strings
